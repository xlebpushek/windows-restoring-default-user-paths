<p align="justify">I am an ardent fan of customizing operating systems, such as windows. I often have to dig into system files and it happens that the system just breaks. In this case, the quickest way to fix the system is to reinstall it. But if we store everything on one volume, we will lose everything, all data. For such cases, I use two volumes, of which one is system, and the second is for data storage. On the second drive, I store all my photos, large downloads, desktop shortcuts, and so on. I do this in order to quickly restore the setting I already have after reinstalling the system. But how ? It's easy, I change the user's folder paths to the corresponding folders located in the second volume of the disk. So, what is this collection of bat files for? The fact is that windows installs OneDrive by default, which in turn does not allow you to change the default path for some user folders. The simplest solution is to modify the registry by running these files. To fix this error, just run the corresponding file as an administrator, after which you can simply change the default path to the one you need.</p>
